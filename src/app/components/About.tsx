                Healthcare in Nigeria faces critical challenges: long wait times at clinics, high consultation costs, limited access to specialists, and the burden of traveling long distances for basic medical advice.

                We saw families struggling to afford quality healthcare and professionals too busy to visit a clinic during work hours. We knew technology could bridge this gap.
